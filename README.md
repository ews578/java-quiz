challenge 4 of the bootcamp creating a timed quiz

For this challenge I was tasked with creating a timed quiz that would deduct time when wrong answers are selected. This challenge by far has been the most challenging in the bootcamp and yet the most rewarding. It really tested my skills I've learned so far as a developer to utilize the skills and resources to make this quiz come alive. The most difficult part of the challenge for me was writing function that would deduct the time when the anser was selected wrong and when to move on to the next question. I originally wrote a code for this function but after several attempts of trying to fix the code that had a bug in it somewhere I decided to write the function from scratch and try it in another way to succeed. I commented out the original function to display the progress I've made.
